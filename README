this repository include most of all my works with partition of graph



inter - dir that save some parts for translator(interpreter) dot
3_mass_1list.h - one of representation of graph in 3 arrays
3_mass_list.h  - one of representation of graph in 3 arrays
3_mass_te.h - one of representation of graph in 3 arrays
3_mass_te_old_list.h  - one of representation of graph in 3 arrays
common.h - some common information used in most files
CSR.c - one of representation of graph in compress sparse row
generator - object file of generator
generator.c - file in that do tests with different structures
gen_matrix.h - library that I can use to generate matrix n*n
greedy_partition.h - one of the partition of graph
greedy_partition_first.h - second edition of greedy_partition
interpreter.sh - file that must interpreted generated dot files from .gv to .ps

kernigan-lin.h - one of the graph partition
list_cormen.h - representation of list that owerwrite in Corman, that based on 
\right_list.h for save graph

list_support.h - some support functions for list
recursive_partition.h - one of the graph partitioning, but this representetion
write wrong, but work :) and used for tests
right_list.h - this the best of my representations of list
right_list_three.h - this file used in 3 list representation
right_list_two.h - this file used in 3 list representation
RRCO_CSR - 
RRCO_CSR.c - one of representation of graph
timer.h - file have usefull funcions to do time tests
tr_converter.h - have funcions to convert struct with graph to dot 
representation
tr_dot_translator.h - have enumeration elements of alphabet of dot language
tr_generator_name.h - file have funtions for generated names, that used for
translate structs that save graph in dot format
